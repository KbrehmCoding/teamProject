Rojin, Krista, Bingxi and Chad's Project


We were still uncomfortable branching and merging on github when we made this, so we slacked it back and forth and had one or two people push it to the repository. So it does not acurately show how much work each person put into it. Krista and Rojin were in charge of the front end while Bingxi and Chad were in charge of the backend.
